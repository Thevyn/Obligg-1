    <!--Short Description-->
    <p id="lp"> Elderly care in Norway today is struggling due to underworking. There are too many sick and needy and too few to take care of them. What if we could reduce the need to have elderly who are not urgently hospitalized in a nursing home, but still with the certainty not be overlooked?</font>

    <!--Features about the watch-->
    <p id="lp">Our product idea is primarily a clock aimed at the elderly who will monitor the user's health condition. The clock that sits on like a regular wristwatch will continuously measure health parameters like; Pulse / heart rate, activity level and blood sugar (for those with needs). Through the display screen of the clock, you can easily monitor your own parameters and make the necessary measures. The clock measures the activity level, if it is low for a long time, the customer will receive a voicemail message asking if everything is as it should. If you do not respond to the message within a given time, it will automatically connect health professionals who can assess the situation. Today's security alarms require that you need to physically press a button to activate, what we want is a clock as by means of different measurements and an artificial intelligence can tell directly to AMK or the nurses if the values drastically change and summon help.
    <br/>The clock will have access to the shooting service and diagnostics that will be updated every 30 seconds. This information is sent to the cloud that healthcare professionals can access. With this information, they can detect abnormal changes in the values, and assess whether the patient needs additional supervision. As the watch continuously monitors activity level, the user can easily offer activities in the area if you want to increase your activity level and suggestions to other users in the area. This is of course a voluntary feature with app connectivity.</font>
